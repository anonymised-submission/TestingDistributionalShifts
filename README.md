# Testing under Distributional Shifts

Welcome to the simulation repository of the paper _Testing under Distributional Shifts_. 
This repository contains the code for the experiments in the paper. 

Each folder in the repository corresponds to one experiment. For each experiment, simulation of data and testing is performed in `Python`, the results are saved as a `.csv` file, and the plots are then made in `R`.
